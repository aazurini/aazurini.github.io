        <p>Car accidents put a dent in your vehicle but also in your bank account. There were <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-traffic-fatalities-estimates-first-quarter-2023/">9,330</a> fatalities from car accidents in the first three months of 2023. With rising insurance rates and auto repair costs at a high, there is even more reason to be cautious on the roads. .</p>

        <p> Car insurance varies by state, zip code, driving record, marriage status, vehicle make and model, driving history/record, credit score, amount of your deductible, and so on. Some states have a more expensive annual insurance plan as it takes into account weather-related accidents and cost of living.</p>

       


        <p>With climate change increasing floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes now more than ever, it's essential to have coverage to keep you and your family safe from the elements. “With the unpredictability of severe weather patterns.  There is zero control over the occurrence, the time of the occurrence, or the severity of the occurrence.  We are at the mercy of Mother Nature. Insurers have attempted to curb the severity of flood damage by using flood-mapping technology, to identify areas/territories/neighborhoods that are more prone to flooding.  This has resulted in property owners having the amount of water damage coverage reduced or entirely removed from their insurance policies.  Similar to parts of the US in areas known as Tornado Alley (Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, etc.), the use of publicly-funded insurance pools responds to incidences.  However, suppose the funding is unable to keep up with the increased number of occurrences and increased severity of occurrences. In that case, the integrity of the fund will be compromised.”, says Chris Weston, Regional VP of Business Development and Broker Financial Solutions at Unica Insurance</p>

        <p> Another aspect that has changed the car insurance world as a climate change effort is electric cars. Insurers are uniquely positioned to influence individuals to use a more eco-friendly approach to driving by including insurance incentives. </p>



        <p> “There are definitely some strategies that the industry and Unica Insurance are committing to. The expansion of risk selection and incentives to encourage the use of more electric vehicles, in addition to installation and use of renewable energy sources in homes & commercial buildings, is directly aligned with our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategies.  Unfortunately, the point to which climate change has reached, just promoting the use and required behavior to reduce the use of resources that have a negative impact on climate change, has spilled over into the need for both Social and Regulatory Governance.  Hence the reason why our organization and more organizations have and will need to dedicate human resources and expenditure to ESG Divisions.”

        <p> In consideration of driving records, insurance companies will look at accidents where you were at fault, DUIs, and your overall driving history since you obtained your license. Mental health coverage is just as crucial since driving anxieties and road rage are becoming a less tolerable issue</p>
        <p>Weston explains that insurers have yet to look at that kind of coverage frequently. “This is not an area that insurers have spent much time investing in from a proactive perspective.  However, much of our organization's donations and sponsorships are spent on supporting mental health. More investment has been placed into prevention, risk management, and protecting the momentum of the insured following a catastrophic event, as any degree of loss can have mental impacts.  It is in our best interest to prevent an incident from happening and, even if it happens, get the insured back to the same mode of operation he/she was in prior to the incident.”</p>
        <p>It can be overwhelming to decide the best plan to stay safe on the roads, so taking your time is of the utmost importance when choosing the most valuable plan for you. Medical costs have been a leading cause of the inflation of insurance policies, “Over the same period, the average <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/auto-insurance-outlook-2024/ Insurance companies will need to pay more for bodily injury liability claims, translating into higher premiums for insurance customers"/>bodily injury claim cost increased by 40%."</a> </p>.

        <p>The revolutionary invention of self-driving cars, while new, is pushing into the insurance scene. However, with new technology comes new problems. “Autonomous vehicles are still not foolproof, and they cost more to repair and are more in value, if unrepairable, as these vehicles still get into accidents.  The technology still has some way to go before it can be prepared for every expected and unforeseen incident that can present itself on roadways and highways.  The verdict is still out on if they will ever be treated on a different level compared to non-autonomous automobiles.” Weston highlighted.</p>
        <p>Since the technology is still being tested, it will be some time until solid policies are in place to keep roads safe. Something important to note is where we fall in creating a safer driving space.</p>
        <p>Weston spoke about some ways we can be responsible for our safety: “As with anything else, the world we live in today depends upon everyone working towards a common goal.  Unfortunately, there will always be people who, until an incident happens to them or it becomes mandatory, will not change their behavior.  We can invest as much as we can into education, technology, live examples, consistent communication, climate control incentives, etc. But suppose there isn’t a change in habits and behavior by the majority of people, organizations, countries, and their relative governing bodies. In that case, it will continue to be an uphill battle with continued global impact.” </p>

</script>

        <p> We are behind the wheel, so we control the outcome and must stay alert to potential hazards. If we can prevent a crash before it happens, that will save more money and time to spend with family. Our responsibility is to be good citizens and take precautions to keep traffic low and safety high. </p>
